# forexpatternrecognition
If there is 2 things I love it is: taking risks and making money. Naturally forex trading became something I wanted to do. 
But I tried and lost over $200 (a lot of money for a 17-year-old) and thought there had to be a better way to 
predict the pattern of pairings. 
So I created a pattern recognition system using machine learning, data snooping, and tons of backtesting.
